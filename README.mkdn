# Google Translator API

## About
This is an example of an API for [Google Translate](http://translate.google.com), created by me (dookie) for personal use.
The aim of this implementation is create a simple command-line to quickly translate anything. It's very helpful for us, programmers, when reading some articles, books, or posts in different languages and we need to translate some word or expression.

## How I use it
I created a alias for my script, like that, in my .bash_profile (I'm using a Mac OS X):

	alias t='ruby /Users/dookie/Projects/Experiencies/Ruby/translate/bin/translate.rb'

And, to execute the translation:

	t [word or expression] [translate language]

	t 'Olá Mundo!' en
	
Then, the result will be:

	Hello world!

## Installing
First of all, get the source code:
	
	git clone git://github.com/dookie/google-translate-api.git


Then run:
	
	ruby bin/install.rb


And enjoy:

	t 'Olá mundo!' de
